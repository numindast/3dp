Personal notes on a doomcube build.

9/7/2024: time to get this document going!

LDO Leviathan MCU
Klipper Expander (bottom bay; for bed thermistor, SSR)
BTT Pi4B v1 adaptor with CM4108032 (8gb, 32gb eMMC)
Waveshare 4.3" DSI LCD display
The Filter (with magnetic power connector)

300x300x300 build volume
Possibly higher Z however umbilicals/PTFE tube may get squashed beyond what's reasonable.

Firmware updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Leviathan MCU is in USB-CANbus-Bridge mode. It's connected to the Pi via USB. We are not using CANbus for toolhead though. That is straight-wired using a harness.

Klipper Expander is USB-connected. Must access the physical boot/reset buttons to put into DFU mode. (This sucks.)

Config notes:
  - debian bullseye rolled out NetworkManager (for bookworm, this is now default). Suspect /network/interfaces.d/can0 references ifconfig for txqueuelen that's being ignored.
    dsavlin@doomcube:/etc/network/interfaces.d $ cat can0
      allow-hotplug can0
        iface can0 can static
      bitrate 1000000
      up ifconfig  txqueuelen 128

      dsavlin@doomcube:/etc/network/interfaces.d $ ifconfig can0
        can0: flags=193<UP,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 16
          unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 10  (UNSPEC)
    Changed "up ifconfig txqueuelen 128" to "up ip link set $IFACE txqueuelen 128" and rebooted pi.
    This seems to have had the desired effect, txqueuelen is now 128 in the output from ifconfig.
    Why? Was getting "mcu: timer too close" shutdowns by merely homing axis.
