Started life as a Creality Ender 3 v2, with the glass bed, tool drawer, and weird color/non-touch display.

Upgrades:
SKR Mini e3v3 with dual Z steppers and klipper macro to bounce the X gantry off the top of the frame to level the gantry. This made levelling the bed much more reliable.
Silicone bed springs
Sprite Pro hot end
Pi drawer replacement mount (very tidy)
Comgrow tent
