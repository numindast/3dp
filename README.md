Bits and bobs. (Related to my 3d printers.)

I've souped up an Ender3v2 and used it to learn a lot about FDM printing in terms of technology.
Of course, my real goal behind getting a USD$200 printer and spending USD$200+ more on it was to build a Voron.

All of this repository is a single file tracking my personal VT.932.
It's public in case someone finds and likes the solutions I've found.
