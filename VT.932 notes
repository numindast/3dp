General state of features over a stock Trident:

 - Dual power switches. One for the 5v PSU to allow the Pi to be powered separately from the controller.
 - All wires ferruled or nylon shrink spade receptacles (etc).
 - Thermal fuse RTV'd onto the heat mat rather than at the edge.
 - Heater mat RTV'd along edges to build plate. (It is not melting off. I messed with it before the RTV set, so it looks like salvador dali's print bed.)
 - Wago (genuine) connectors for all mains wiring with ferruled wires.
 - Heatsink with (very) kludgy thermistor attached with RTV for the SSR. In practice, it barely throws off any heat.
 - Fysetc CAN stealthburner toolhead PCB with Fysetc premade cable as a rough umbilical.
 - X and Y axis endstops relocated to side of TAP and back of right side Y extrusion. No more drag chains.
 - Stealthburner with CAS fitting and ERCF filament sensor wired to toolhead PCB.
   (update 4/5/2023: thanks to [Dave]'s video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1gxBCiE0pk (also pinned in discord #afterburner_and_stealthburner_questions)
 - BTT PiTFT 5" LCD with elegant skirt mount (DSI driven, capacitive touch, LED backlit, rotary encoder for brightness, powered by DSI)
 - swapped the Pi 4b for a CM4 4gb/32gb on board with wifi (so 4104032) on a Waveshare carrier (CM4-IO-BASE-B rev4)
 - Pi Camera v3 wide angle tucked over left side front idler. Need a better way to run the FPC cable. Might not be the best location.
 - yawl-controller (esp8266) running WLED to drive 3 disco-on-a-sticks
 - BME680 temp/humidity/barometer/gas sensor attached to Pi I2C
 - Nevermore mounted vertical against back right with airflow going straight up
 
~~~ TO DO ~~~
1. move BME680 to opposite back extrusion. this way nevermore blows air past it for better readings
2. wire covers for 2020 channels for lighting wiring
3. buy black zip ties. seriously, day-glo orange?
4. print more usable zip tie mounts that actually fit and are snug
5. redo light bar baffles in white ABS or ASA
6. serial connection from Pi to yawl-controller
7. find a way to make the Pi camera FPC not ugly...



--- note: the fans were redone. redo this section
fan0: PA13 - nevermore
fan1: PA14 - skirt fan
fan2: PB2 - skirt fan

optoTAP:
use IO.2 on sb-can-toolhead.
pin1 = 5v (NOTE: silkscreen says 24v, however wiki has well documented this error and it really is 5v.)
pin2 = gnd
pin3 = signal / IO.2 (PB7)
pin3 = closest to stepper connector.

toolhead pcb:
silkscreen errors: IO.2 (PB7) silkscreen says 24v, this is actually 5v
silkscreen errors: (PB6) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
silkscreen errors: IN.0 (PA3) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
also CANL and CANH are "TX and RX" respectively as printed.

IN.0 = will be for X endstop
IO.1 = ERCF filament sensor
IO.2 = optoTAP sensor

Compiling all the firmware.
Yikes. This is a long way from an ender 3.

Spider v2.2: https://wiki.fysetc.com/Spider/#421-menuconfig
  1. Enable extra low level configuration options
     1.1 Microcontroller architecture: STM32F446 / 12 MHz crystal / 32KIB BOOTLOADER / Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)
     1.2 GPIO pins to set at startup: String = !PA13 (why? because the bright red LED for this unused fan port is annoying, and default at boot is ON)
     1.3 make
     
  2. https://www.klipper3d.org/SDCard_Updates.html to flash it onto the Spider.
       sudo service klipper stop
       ./scripts/flash-sdcard.sh /dev/ttyAMA0  fysetc-spider
       sudo service klipper start
     
Toolhead PCB: Fysetc SB-CAN-TH using whatever bootloader Fysetc put on it
  Refer to https://wiki.fysetc.com/SB%20CAN%20ToolHead/#32-firmware-upload
  
  1. Enable extra low level configuration options
     1.1 Microcontroller architecture: STM32F072 / no bootloader offset / 8 MHz crystal / CAN bus PB8/PB9 / CAN speed 500000
  2. Flash to the toolhead:
     2.1. Power down the printer, but keep Pi powered on. Attach USB cable from toolhead to the Pi. Power the printer back on.
     2.2. Check 'lsusb' to show the toolhead board in DFU mode
     3.3. dfu-util -R -a 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D out/klipper.bin
   
Toolhead PCB: Fysetc SB-CAN-TH using CanBoot bootloader
  NOTE: could not get this to work. I don't think it's entering the bootloader after flashing canboot, and there's no hardware reset/boot
        switches to force entry into the bootloader.
        
  Refer to https://www.klipper3d.org/Bootloaders.html#stm32f103stm32f0x2-with-canboot-bootloader

since last update:
installed TAP
swapped Pi4b for CM4
tore out X drag chain
solved weird back-slanted bed mesh by adjusting the Y extrusion where it meets the frame (just on the right side) until bed mesh was much better
put pi-cam-v3 on (standard angle) and deemed it too narrow for use in the enclosure, tried 3 spots, bought a wide angle.
found mound of black abs dust gathered below the extruder atop the toolhead "cartridge". uh oh. spent a bunch of time diagnosing this.
  another video by "Dave" on discord led to the correct way to fit the antisquish screw and adjust gear mesh. the former should 100% solve 
  the grinding to dust issue. can't find worn pieces?

update 4/7/2023: got SB rebuilt and live adjusted Y extrusion on right side again, ran the probe accuracy scripts, came out decent. 
Installed new wide angle pi camera, oh boy is it wide. Can see one of my monitors.

however new problems: 
extruder has a nice click when retracting / unretracting. maybe set the gear mesh a little too loose
The big issue is loud grinding when Z is +25 or so and in a big move. Printer needs to be stripped down at least partly to determine why this change happened. 
suspect it's the front left.

new update 4/23/2023
 - Overheating toolhead pcb! While printing a small batch of small parts, all close together, the toolhead MCU jumped to just over 100Â°C and crashed
   with an adc temp error. This was while I had no cover installed at all. I found a SB cable cover with 3010 fan and built it out. Downside it runs
   at all times when the printer is powered (currently using IN.0 for its 24v and ground, the PB6 pin is unused). Should split with the toolhead heat sink
   fan so it will go on and off.
 - Got two "production" and one "fixer upper" Disco on a Sticks from deathbyxbox to install along top frame L, front, R. Looks great. Working on baffles
   when the toolhead MCU crashed.

new update 5/16/2023
Taking printer out of service to do a bunch of minor upgrades.
 - 3 disco sticks with (18) SK6822 RGBCW's on each now installed with an esp8266-based "yawl-controller". Power is fed from the 5A available to a raspberry pi from the
   Spider, which wasn't being used as I prefer the Meanwell 25-5 supply for the Pi with its separate AC power switch. The LEDs should not draw more than 3.1A but I should be
   careful since dupont pin headers aren't rated for more than 2.5A. Having lights powered by the Spider does mean when the Spider is powered off, there's no lights.
 - Added BME680 sensor wired to I2C on the Pi. Added the Pi as an MCU as well. Added to Klipper and it shows up on the Moonraker UI. That was easy. Found a print to mount it to
   an extrusion.
 - Relocate Y endstop switch to the back of the right side Y extrusion. Didn't seem to work on testing endstops in the GUI, need to break out a multimeter. Of course.
   Bummer, I already fixed all the wiring in place and made it look neat. Before testing it. Dumb.
 - ToDo: Rebuild TAP using r8 parts and better magnets. Add X endstop switch there. Thinking about rebuilding SB with a better print but that's a hassle and may just skip it.
 - ToDo: build new Nevermore and mount in the back, pointing upward
 - ToDo: rebuild SB cover fan wiring to share toolhead's fan output for the cold side heatsink. Why? We need IN.0 for the new X endstop switch.
 
Far off in the future todo's:
  - ERCF
  - TinyFan v2 board + 4 wires added to umbilical = add PWM fan with tachometer to toolhead cold side heatsink fan. Macros available to monitor the fan speed and shut down
    the print job to protect against clogs deep in the hot end.
  - Serial connection to UART2 on the Pi4b for the WLED controller, so no wifi necessary to operate WLED (this is a big maybe .. is it even worth the effort, since I like the GUI?)
  - Redo BME680 wires with slightly longer, hopefully much prettier wire or cable

new update 6/22/2023
  - New: built teamfdm/window ventilation kit for voron exhaust (and printed/assembled the exhaust parts). Works great. Need to secure window against burglers.
  - Broke: bme680. commented out in printer.cfg till the wiring can be looked at.
  - ToDo: build a second stealthburner. This one will have the BTT toolhead pcb, which should allow me to use a 3-pin fan, and also bought a rainbow barf for the logo. And have the hardware now for TAP r8 kit.
  - ToDo: purge bucket
  - ToDo: reprint disco stick baffles in ASA white instead of black to enhance light spread and reduce sharp shadow steps.
  
new update 7/8/2023
  - printer died: toolhead 'mcu' ADC out of range (negative 10 celsius definitely qualifies). Unsure what happened yet. Did klipper update several times on the host RPi when I did not also update the toolhead 
    mcu (etc). Perhaps it's time.
  - new version of KAMP took some effort to fix up. No more voron purge, back to line purge.
  - I officially hate universal auto rewinder. It has cost a lot of extruder overload leading to failed prints. This sucks.
  - Purge bucket ready to mount
  - White ASA LED baffles set to install on one stick

new update 7/12/2023
  - TE0 on the SB-CAN-TH appears to be dead. Tested against my older pcb, on which I broke the connector housing, but a (properly crimped!) JST-PH will still /snick/ into place. Using that pcb to run.
  - Going to start on 2nd SB with SB2209 pretty soon. All the parts are sitting on my desk. This maybe supercedes all the other to-do's.
       - Orion OD4010-24HB01A 3-pin axial fan for hot end.
       - Sunon 24v 5015 blower (Mellow)
       - LDO Motors LDO-36STH20-1004AHG pancake stepper for CW2, with RNC coated BMG clone gears
       - Prewired Rainbow BARF toolhead LED logo, with resin printed diffuser/tray
       - Polymaker ABS purple and black SB parts, already printed. This set would replace the (still perfectly fine!) parts printed on my Ender. Nostalgic?
  - Still to do: relocate BME680/troubleshoot it, white LED baffles, purge bucket/brush, ... ercf 2.0 ... maybe ... many of these projects might have to wait until wintertime.

new update 7/26/2023
  - printer is still a-printin'. using that same toolhead pcb with the broken TE0 connector, hasn't been giving any problems. Still have not taken out of service.
  - been researching better anti-tangle setups I can use in a drybox.
  - reprinted some SB parts, sans overextrusion, and continuing build:
      Runice RNC coated BMG extruder kit from dfh
      CW2 w/ECAS04 plus filament sensor kit from dfh
      Resin printed LED diffuser and carrier from Ether on Discord
      Funssor pre-wired rainbow BARF and rgbw LEDs / ptfe wires
      Sunon 5015 24v blower (Mellow on Aliexpress)
      LDO-36STH20-1004AHG high temp stepper for extruder (Mellow on Aliexpress)
      BTT EBB2209 two part toolhead pcb
      Orion OD4010-24HB ball bearing 24v fan with speed sensor for heatsink.
      Rapido HF hot end

new update 10/21/2023: Total Print Time	847h 34m 58s
  - cc the top line in the last update. it's still printing and doing quite nicely thank you. very happy with this setup.
  - side news: took a QC reject disco stick (with just sk6812cww's) and attached it to a yawl-controller powered with a USB battery bank with an inline switch. Our front closet is much happier.
  - zero progress on mods or builds. the bme680 is still unused, as I don't care for it to cause klipper to shutdown if it suddenly disconnects from the pi again. kinda miss chamber temps.
  
new update 11/4/2023: Total Print Time 1033h 12m 37s
  - printer is still a-printin'. however, printing ASA is getting frustrating as I think chamber temps (mid 50's at best) are not high enough. Getting layer splits on prints.
  - installing 2 bed fans, driven by FAN0
  - found loose pins on the BME680 on the Pi headers. Fixed. Still might redo the sensor with new 5-conductor silicon ribbon cable in the future.
  - Toolhead was having issues with thermistor connection getting bad. Rerouted the wire and hope it stays in that busted connector. New toolhead with new PCB still waiting on build time.
