General state of features over a stock Trident:

 - Dual power switches. One for the 5v PSU to allow the Pi to be powered separately from the controller.
 - Thermal fuse RTV'd onto the heat mat rather than at the edge.
 - Heater mat RTV'd along edges to build plate. (It is not melting off. I messed with it before the RTV set, so it looks like salvador dali's print bed.)
 - Wago (genuine) connectors for all mains wiring with ferruled wires.
 - Heatsink with (very) kludgy thermistor attached with RTV for the SSR. In practice, it barely throws off any heat.
 - BTT SB2209 toolhead CAN board and umbilical.
 - X and Y axis endstops relocated to side of TAP and back of right side Y extrusion. No more drag chains.
 - Stealthburner with LDO Galileo 2 from dfh and Rapido HF and rainbow barf logo LEDs
 - BTT PiTFT 5" LCD with elegant skirt mount (DSI driven, capacitive touch, LED backlit, rotary encoder for brightness, powered by DSI)
 - Raspberry Pi CM4 4gb/32gb on board with wifi (so 4104032) on a Waveshare carrier (CM4-IO-BASE-B rev4)
 - Pi Camera v3 wide angle tucked over left side front idler. Need a better way to run the FPC cable. Might not be the best location.
 - yawl-controller (esp8266) running WLED to drive 3 disco-on-a-sticks
 - BME680 temp/humidity/barometer/gas sensor attached to Pi I2C
 - Nevermore mounted vertical against back right with airflow going straight up
 - Two bed fans
 - Tinyfan controller with 4-wire exhaust fan

~~~ TO DO ~~~
2. wire covers for 2020 channels for lighting wiring
5. redo light bar baffles in white ABS or ASA - one of 3 done, looks great
6. serial connection from Pi to yawl-controller
7. find a way to make the Pi camera FPC not ugly...
8. Replace non-silicone wiring for LED sticks with silicone. There's a poor connection somewhere and causes issues at startup.

tinyfan pins: 
  FAN1_PWM, FAN1_RPM (for the exhaust fan)
  FAN4_PWM (for the skirt fans)
  LED (ws2812 on board?)

controller fans:
  fan0: PA13 - nevermore

optoTAP:
use IO.2 on sb-can-toolhead.
pin1 = 5v (NOTE: silkscreen says 24v, however wiki has well documented this error and it really is 5v.)
pin2 = gnd
pin3 = signal / IO.2 (PB7)
pin3 = closest to stepper connector.

toolhead pcb:
silkscreen errors: IO.2 (PB7) silkscreen says 24v, this is actually 5v
silkscreen errors: (PB6) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
silkscreen errors: IN.0 (PA3) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
also CANL and CANH are "TX and RX" respectively as printed.

IN.0 = (was X endstop, but since the filament sensor switch is disconnected, moving x endstop for ease of JST-PH connecting.)
IO.1 = X endstop (was ERCF filament sensor)
IO.2 = optoTAP sensor

Compiling all the firmware.
Yikes. This is a long way from an ender 3.

Spider v2.2: https://wiki.fysetc.com/Spider/#421-menuconfig
  1. Enable extra low level configuration options
     1.1 Microcontroller architecture: STM32F446 / 12 MHz crystal / 32KIB BOOTLOADER / Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9)
     1.2 GPIO pins to set at startup: String = !PA13 (why? because the bright red LED for this unused fan port is annoying, and default at boot is ON)
     1.3 make
     
  2. https://www.klipper3d.org/SDCard_Updates.html to flash it onto the Spider.

  1. Enable extra low level configuration options
     1.1 Microcontroller architecture: STM32F072 / no bootloader offset / 8 MHz crystal / CAN bus PB8/PB9 / CAN speed 500000
  2. Flash to the toolhead:
     2.1. Power down the printer, but keep Pi powered on. Attach USB cable from toolhead to the Pi. Power the printer back on.
     2.2. Check 'lsusb' to show the toolhead board in DFU mode

since last update:
installed TAP
swapped Pi4b for CM4
tore out X drag chain
solved weird back-slanted bed mesh by adjusting the Y extrusion where it meets the frame (just on the right side) until bed mesh was much better
put pi-cam-v3 on (standard angle) and deemed it too narrow for use in the enclosure, tried 3 spots, bought a wide angle.
found mound of black abs dust gathered below the extruder atop the toolhead "cartridge". uh oh. spent a bunch of time diagnosing this.
  another video by "Dave" on discord led to the correct way to fit the antisquish screw and adjust gear mesh. the former should 100% solve 
  the grinding to dust issue. can't find worn pieces?

update 4/7/2023: got SB rebuilt and live adjusted Y extrusion on right side again, ran the probe accuracy scripts, came out decent. 
Installed new wide angle pi camera, oh boy is it wide. Can see one of my monitors.

however new problems: 
extruder has a nice click when retracting / unretracting. maybe set the gear mesh a little too loose
The big issue is loud grinding when Z is +25 or so and in a big move. Printer needs to be stripped down at least partly to determine why this change happened. 
suspect it's the front left.

new update 4/23/2023
 - Overheating toolhead pcb! While printing a small batch of small parts, all close together, the toolhead MCU jumped to just over 100Â°C and crashed
   with an adc temp error. This was while I had no cover installed at all. I found a SB cable cover with 3010 fan and built it out. Downside it runs
   at all times when the printer is powered (currently using IN.0 for its 24v and ground, the PB6 pin is unused). Should split with the toolhead heat sink
   fan so it will go on and off.
 - Got two "production" and one "fixer upper" Disco on a Sticks from deathbyxbox to install along top frame L, front, R. Looks great. Working on baffles
   when the toolhead MCU crashed.
   
--
new update 5/16/2023
Taking printer out of service to do a bunch of minor upgrades.
 - 3 disco sticks with (18) SK6822 RGBCW's on each now installed with an esp8266-based "yawl-controller". Power is fed from the 5A available to a raspberry pi from the
   Spider, which wasn't being used as I prefer the Meanwell 25-5 supply for the Pi with its separate AC power switch. The LEDs should not draw more than 3.1A but I should be
   careful since dupont pin headers aren't rated for more than 2.5A. Having lights powered by the Spider does mean when the Spider is powered off, there's no lights.
 - Added BME680 sensor wired to I2C on the Pi. Added the Pi as an MCU as well. Added to Klipper and it shows up on the Moonraker UI. That was easy. Found a print to mount it to
   an extrusion.
 - Relocate Y endstop switch to the back of the right side Y extrusion. Didn't seem to work on testing endstops in the GUI, need to break out a multimeter. Of course.
   Bummer, I already fixed all the wiring in place and made it look neat. Before testing it. Dumb.
 - ToDo: Rebuild TAP using r8 parts and better magnets. Add X endstop switch there. Thinking about rebuilding SB with a better print but that's a hassle and may just skip it.
 - ToDo: build new Nevermore and mount in the back, pointing upward
 - ToDo: rebuild SB cover fan wiring to share toolhead's fan output for the cold side heatsink. Why? We need IN.0 for the new X endstop switch.
 
Far off in the future todo's:
  - ERCF
  - TinyFan v2 board + 4 wires added to umbilical = add PWM fan with tachometer to toolhead cold side heatsink fan. Macros available to monitor the fan speed and shut down
    the print job to protect against clogs deep in the hot end.
  - Serial connection to UART2 on the Pi4b for the WLED controller, so no wifi necessary to operate WLED (this is a big maybe .. is it even worth the effort, since I like the GUI?)
  - Redo BME680 wires with slightly longer, hopefully much prettier wire or cable
  
--
new update 6/22/2023
  - New: built teamfdm/window ventilation kit for voron exhaust (and printed/assembled the exhaust parts). Works great. Need to secure window against burglers.
  - Broke: bme680. commented out in printer.cfg till the wiring can be looked at.
  - ToDo: build a second stealthburner. This one will have the BTT toolhead pcb, which should allow me to use a 3-pin fan, and also bought a rainbow barf for the logo. And have the hardware now for TAP r8 kit.
  - ToDo: purge bucket
  - ToDo: reprint disco stick baffles in ASA white instead of black to enhance light spread and reduce sharp shadow steps.
  
new update 7/8/2023
  - printer died: toolhead 'mcu' ADC out of range (negative 10 celsius definitely qualifies). Unsure what happened yet. Did klipper update several times on the host RPi when I did not also update the toolhead 
    mcu (etc). Perhaps it's time.
  - new version of KAMP took some effort to fix up. No more voron purge, back to line purge.
  - I officially hate universal auto rewinder. It has cost a lot of extruder overload leading to failed prints. This sucks.
  - Purge bucket ready to mount
  - White ASA LED baffles set to install on one stick

new update 7/12/2023
  - TE0 on the SB-CAN-TH appears to be dead. Tested against my older pcb, on which I broke the connector housing, but a (properly crimped!) JST-PH will still /snick/ into place. Using that pcb to run.
  - Going to start on 2nd SB with SB2209 pretty soon. All the parts are sitting on my desk. This maybe supercedes all the other to-do's.
       - Orion OD4010-24HB01A 3-pin axial fan for hot end.
       - Sunon 24v 5015 blower (Mellow)
       - LDO Motors LDO-36STH20-1004AHG pancake stepper for CW2, with RNC coated BMG clone gears
       - Prewired Rainbow BARF toolhead LED logo, with resin printed diffuser/tray
       - Polymaker ABS purple and black SB parts, already printed. This set would replace the (still perfectly fine!) parts printed on my Ender. Nostalgic?
  - Still to do: relocate BME680/troubleshoot it, white LED baffles, purge bucket/brush, ... ercf 2.0 ... maybe ... many of these projects might have to wait until wintertime.

new update 7/26/2023
  - printer is still a-printin'. using that same toolhead pcb with the broken TE0 connector, hasn't been giving any problems. Still have not taken out of service.
  - been researching better anti-tangle setups I can use in a drybox.
  - reprinted some SB parts, sans overextrusion, and continuing build:
      Runice RNC coated BMG extruder kit from dfh
      CW2 w/ECAS04 plus filament sensor kit from dfh
      Resin printed LED diffuser and carrier from Ether on Discord
      Funssor pre-wired rainbow BARF and rgbw LEDs / ptfe wires
      Sunon 5015 24v blower (Mellow on Aliexpress)
      LDO-36STH20-1004AHG high temp stepper for extruder (Mellow on Aliexpress)
      BTT EBB2209 two part toolhead pcb
      Orion OD4010-24HB ball bearing 24v fan with speed sensor for heatsink.
      Rapido HF hot end

new update 10/21/2023: Total Print Time	847h 34m 58s
  - cc the top line in the last update. it's still printing and doing quite nicely thank you. very happy with this setup.
  - side news: took a QC reject disco stick (with just sk6812cww's) and attached it to a yawl-controller powered with a USB battery bank with an inline switch. Our front closet is much happier.
  - zero progress on mods or builds. the bme680 is still unused, as I don't care for it to cause klipper to shutdown if it suddenly disconnects from the pi again. kinda miss chamber temps.
  
new update 11/4/2023: Total Print Time 1033h 12m 37s
  - printer is still a-printin'. however, printing ASA is getting frustrating as I think chamber temps (mid 50's at best) are not high enough. Getting layer splits on prints.
  - installing 2 bed fans, driven by FAN0
  - found loose pins on the BME680 on the Pi headers. Fixed. Still might redo the sensor with new 5-conductor silicon ribbon cable in the future.
  - Toolhead was having issues with thermistor connection getting bad. Rerouted the wire and hope it stays in that busted connector. New toolhead with new PCB still waiting on build time.

new update 11/7/2023
  - so, the BTT smart filament sensor loves to trip the print pause when there's no issue, other than making tons of little dits for supports (frequent retraction and tiny extrudes).
  - also, the timelapse (hyperlapse) sucks. it will trigger even when paused. which then causes an error and cancels the print. that really blows.
    so you're changing filament, and the toolhead rips out of your hands to go take a picture, which fails because it was paused and the extruder isn't hot enough, and klipper bombs the job.

new update 11/15/2023: Total Print Time 1096h 10m 49s
  - Re-re-rebuilt SB this time swapping extruder gears. The installed gears have done 100% of all prints so far, well above the hours as they predate the Pi CM4 install.
    Swapped in a set from (dfh?west3d?) RNC hardened steel gears, Trianglelab I believe. To be checked. Been having under-extrusion events that are not because of partial blockages or other issues.
    Reinstalled the SB and promptly had a toolhead crash which broke the Tap front. Shit. I can't find the MGN9 rail assembly tool that keeps the carriage's ball bearings in place to swap.
    Reinstalled the broken TAP to try and see if I can coax a print out of this to redo that. Printed a tool and tried to start a long print but same extrusion pauses.
  - Broke the latch on the clockwork. Had to disassemble/reassemble AGAIN with a spare. Also changed to a new 0.4 brass nozzle.

12/14/2023: 1374h
  - now having extruder feed problems even after rebuilding. can print slowly. maybe sort out the new toolhead. have orbiter v2, might need printed parts.

12/17/2023: 1375h
  - Printed a bit more but still having issues. Did a full rebuild again. Changed direction and am re-tuning for the undertaker nozzle + new smooth bed w/ABS to print orbiter parts.
  - Wish list: LRS-50-5 power supply. It'll fit. Can then feed 5v to yawl-controller so it's independent of the spider controller.
  - Multiple times TH0 has gotten janky and caused a klipper shutdown during prints. Pulled off the broken TH0 JST connector housing (left the pins intact) and soldered a JST-PH socket
    to the bare pins on the board. Plugged in the thermistor to that. Doing more tuning prints, hopefully this TH0 will no longer be an issue, or at least long enough to build an
    orbiter2 + btt toolhead.

12/29/2023: 
  - Finished printing Galileo 2 extruder parts in ABS without issue. Switched to print some PLA for fun and had some rude skipping despite not being clogged, and decided then and there this CW2
    was coming out and the Galileo2's time to be built has come. Perhaps I just built this one wrong. Perhaps I am using it wrong. I'm tired of rebuilding CW2.
     - build notes: need to find a "fan cover" with umbilical mount, but note: umbilical mount looks like it's gonna need an M3x55 SHCS screw which there are zero of, to replace
       the lower stepper screw. M3x50 is not long enough. there may be other, better ideas out on voronmods or printables or ...

1/1/2024: 1391h, or ? 0h since birth of galileo2 extruder?
  - New extruder seems to be running like a champ. Working on (new)tuning a new brand PLA filament to see how the experience goes, then will re-check ABS tune and print some
    parts to enable the umbilical and fancooled pcb.

1/22/2024: 1479h 35m 41s (actively printing)
  - TAP came noticeably loose. The entire toolhead could wiggle along the X plane by twisting, easily. I think these were new TAP prints and by now they are broken in. Tightened everything
    down. Almost lost a few bearings from the TAP carriage. It's not smooth but smooth enough.
  - Noticed the left top XY joint broke. Layer separation right where the very top meets the pulley support. That bolt is still on solid ground on top and bottom. Decided to print
    replacements with Polymaker ABS Galactic Dark Grey (sparkle). Am considering using sparkle green for accent, if I like how it looks. With older parts still purple/black it'll be
    my VT.Frankenstein. 
  - ** This is the first time any of the ender3-printed VT parts have failed. Two years and more than 1500 hours of service.
  - Had several bolts loose, tightened up all I could reach.
To do:
  - Fix BME680 wiring
  - Reterminate LED stick wiring. Consider upgrading the Pi supply (5v/5a) and powering LED sticks from there. That would be very handy and would take the load off the controller.

1/27/2024: 1490h 15s
  - Replaced broken top left XY joint. Didn't replace all the rest of the XY joints, they all look and feel solid, and having a pretty printer is not really a goal. Patchwork look is fine by me.
  - Replaced janky motor-wire-wired-BME680 with better silicon jacket high strand wire between the Pi and the sensor.
  - Replaced 25w 5v supply with 50w 5v supply, and wired yawl-controller's power to that instead of the controller board. Now the 5v supply (on its independent power switch) drives lighting too.
  - Wired CM4 carrier module to get power from a hacked up USB-C cable rather than via the GPIO pins. 
  - Relocated Nevermore to the other side. Broke the 2 pin inline connector so replaced with a wago-clone-thing.
  - The lighting's flakiness was due to loose connection on the screw terminals at the yawl-controller. Made sure those are all tight, no problems, skipping replacing the wire, doing
    JST pins on silicone wire sucks.
  - Printed a test cube with foggy grey/purple pla. Came out snazzy. Printer back in action.

2/8/2024: 1563h 38m 6s
  - Adding Fysetc Hotkey Buttons to the skirts, new skirts needed. also bought a 4-pin fan for the exhaust, need to print tinyfan mount. after that going to cut some reflectix
    for the back of the printer. Did a Klipper update and now none of the MCUs will talk until they are updated, so working on that next.

2/16/2024: 1581h 58m 26s
  - Cooked the Fysetc SB-CAN-TH and the UCAN via what appear to be loose ground connections at the 24v power supply. Confirmed by buying a new UCAN and hooking both the in-use
    toolhead pcb and the old one with a broken TH0. Old one came alive on the CAN bus, in-use one would not.
  - Tightened up every screw in existence.
  - Installed Galileo 2 onto new SB with BTT EBB SB2209 toolhead board and ran new umbilical. Using this with Fysetc UCAN. Works great.
    The new SB has rainbow barf logo, 4 pin CUI Devices 4010 fan for hotend (now reports RPM!), and a Sunon Maglev blower (two wire).
  - Installed new ChaoticLabs CNC TAP v2.
  - Having serious issues loading filament. It gets stuck at multiple points before exiting the extruder. Need to investigate further / reprint extruder parts maybe.

2/17/2024: 1590h 21m 12s
  - New toolhead is working well, with the caveat that loading filament absolutely sucks. Plan is to fix up everything else on the printer that's been needing attention and circle
    back to this, perhaps with a re-tune of ABS and rebuild a new CW2 with ERCF sensor.
  - Installed tinyfan board, however, all fans I've tried run at random speeds at startup and idle even when klipper says "off". Ordered a new one, and for now,
    running fans off the Spider instead.
  - Succeeded at animated toolhead LEDs. It's kind of obnoxious at times. Need to set the nozzle LEDs not to mimic the rainbow barf.
  - Cleaned up toolhead umbilical and much of the ugly wiring. Did not replace LED ribbon with black (yet). Would rather print 2020 slot covers to hide the wires.
  - Mounted thermistor (only slightly half assed).

2/22/2024: 1617h 19m 22s
  - G2E works well enough, still sucks loading filament. Now printing 0.1mm layer height CW2 and G2E back plates and investigating
    an ERCF G2E hacky-mod on printables for G2E with Filametrix and dual sensors. Hacky because the CAD for G2E is not released so it's a hack piece.
  - Added Reflectix panels to top and back. Stable chamber temps went from 55c to 65c. (wow!)
  - Re-cut PTFE between extruder and hot end a tiny bit longer. Seems to have helped a little. Loading filament still gets stuck inside the extruder.

4/6/2024: 2006h 17m 58s
  - Printer is still workin'. Added ACM panel to top and have deck & back panels to install. May buy some insulation board to use either inside or outside depending on looks.
  - Loading filament still sucks but will try using load/unload macros and see if I have a drill bit small enough to chamfer the PTFE tube in the hot end.
