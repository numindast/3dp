General state of features over a stock Trident:

 - Dual power switches. One for the 5v PSU to allow the Pi to be powered separately from the controller.
 - All wires ferruled or nylon shrink spade receptacles (etc).
 - Thermal fuse RTV'd onto the heat mat rather than at the edge.
 - Heater mat RTV'd along edges to build plate.
 - Wago (genuine) connectors for all mains wiring with ferruled wires.
 - Heatsink with (very) kludgy thermistor attached with RTV for the SSR.
 - Fysetc CAN stealthburner toolhead PCB with Fysetc premade cable as a rough umbilical. Goal is to print A drive cable cover and (? piano wire? to help support the cable?)
 - Y axis cable chain still in place. Gonna look into sensorless homing eventually but for now, it just has endstop pod wires, not exactly a heavy load, just not pretty.
 - Stealthburner with CAS fitting and ERCF filament sensor wired to toolhead PCB.
   (update 4/5/2023: thanks to [Dave]'s video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1gxBCiE0pk (also pinned in discord #afterburner_and_stealthburner_questions)
 - BTT PiTFT 5" LCD with elegant skirt mount (DSI driven, capacitive touch, LED backlit, rotary encoder for brightness, powered by DSI)
 - swapped the Pi 4b for a CM4 4gb/32gb on board with wifi (so 4104032) on a Waveshare carrier (CM4-IO-BASE-B rev4)
 - Pi Camera v3 wide angle tucked over left side front idler. Need a better way to run the FPC cable. Might not be the best location.

fan0: PA13 - nevermore
fan1: PA14 - skirt fan
fan2: PB2 - skirt fan

optoTAP:
use IO.2 on sb-can-toolhead.
pin1 = 5v (NOTE: silkscreen says 24v, however wiki has well documented this error and it really is 5v.)
pin2 = gnd
pin3 = signal / IO.2 (PB7)

pin3 = closest to stepper connector.

toolhead pcb:
silkscreen errors: IO.2 (PB7) silkscreen says 24v, this is actually 5v
silkscreen errors: (PB6) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
silkscreen errors: IN.0 (PA3) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
also CANL and CANH are "TX and RX" respectively as printed.

since last update:
installed TAP
swapped Pi4b for CM4
tore out X drag chain
solved weird back-slanted bed mesh by adjusting the Y extrusion where it meets the frame (just on the right side) until bed mesh was much better
put pi-cam-v3 on (standard angle) and deemed it too narrow for use in the enclosure, tried 3 spots, bought a wide angle.
found mound of black abs dust gathered below the extruder atop the toolhead "cartridge". uh oh. spent a bunch of time diagnosing this.
  another video by "Dave" on discord led to the correct way to fit the antisquish screw and adjust gear mesh. the former should 100% solve 
  the grinding to dust issue. can't find worn pieces?

update 4/7/2023: got SB rebuilt and live adjusted Y extrusion on right side again, ran the probe accuracy scripts, came out decent. 
Installed new wide angle pi camera, oh boy is it wide. Can see one of my monitors.

however new problems: 
extruder has a nice click when retracting / unretracting. maybe set the gear mesh a little too loose
The big issue is loud grinding when Z is +25 or so and in a big move. Printer needs to be stripped down at least partly to determine why this change happened. 
suspect it's the front left.
