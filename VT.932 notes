General state of features over a stock Trident:

 - Dual power switches. One for the 5v PSU to allow the Pi to be powered separately from the controller.
 - All wires ferruled or nylon shrink spade receptacles (etc).
 - Thermal fuse RTV'd onto the heat mat rather than at the edge.
 - Heater mat RTV'd along edges to build plate.
 - Wago (genuine) connectors for all mains wiring with ferruled wires.
 - Heatsink with (very) kludgy thermistor attached with RTV for the SSR.
 - Fysetc CAN stealthburner toolhead PCB. Note, cable is sheathed as it came from Fysetc inside drag chain. Considering umbilical.
 - Stealthburner with CAS fitting and ERCF filament sensor wired to toolhead PCB.

fan0: PA13 - nevermore
fan1: PA14 - skirt fan
fan2: PB2 - skirt fan

optoTAP:
use IO.2 on sb-can-toolhead.
pin1 = 5v (NOTE: silkscreen says 24v, however wiki has well documented this error and it really is 5v.)
pin2 = gnd
pin3 = signal / IO.2 (PB7)

pin3 = closest to stepper connector.

toolhead pcb:
silkscreen errors: IO.2 (PB7) silkscreen says 24v, this is actually 5v
silkscreen errors: (PB6) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
silkscreen errors: IN.0 (PA3) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
also CANL and CANH are "TX and RX" respectively as printed.
