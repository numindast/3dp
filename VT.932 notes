General state of features over a stock Trident:

 - Dual power switches. One for the 5v PSU to allow the Pi to be powered separately from the controller.
 - All wires ferruled or nylon shrink spade receptacles (etc).
 - Thermal fuse RTV'd onto the heat mat rather than at the edge.
 - Heater mat RTV'd along edges to build plate.
 - Wago (genuine) connectors for all mains wiring with ferruled wires.
 - Heatsink with (very) kludgy thermistor attached with RTV for the SSR.
 - Fysetc CAN stealthburner toolhead PCB with Fysetc premade cable as a rough umbilical. Goal is to print A drive cable cover and (? piano wire? to help support the cable?)
 - X and Y axis endstops relocated to side of TAP and back of right side Y extrusion. No more drag chains.
 - Stealthburner with CAS fitting and ERCF filament sensor wired to toolhead PCB.
   (update 4/5/2023: thanks to [Dave]'s video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1gxBCiE0pk (also pinned in discord #afterburner_and_stealthburner_questions)
 - BTT PiTFT 5" LCD with elegant skirt mount (DSI driven, capacitive touch, LED backlit, rotary encoder for brightness, powered by DSI)
 - swapped the Pi 4b for a CM4 4gb/32gb on board with wifi (so 4104032) on a Waveshare carrier (CM4-IO-BASE-B rev4)
 - Pi Camera v3 wide angle tucked over left side front idler. Need a better way to run the FPC cable. Might not be the best location.
 - yawl-controller (esp8266) running WLED to drive 3 disco-on-a-sticks
 - BME680 temp/humidity/barometer/gas sensor attached to Pi I2C
 

--- note: the fans were redone. need to check
fan0: PA13 - nevermore
fan1: PA14 - skirt fan
fan2: PB2 - skirt fan

optoTAP:
use IO.2 on sb-can-toolhead.
pin1 = 5v (NOTE: silkscreen says 24v, however wiki has well documented this error and it really is 5v.)
pin2 = gnd
pin3 = signal / IO.2 (PB7)
pin3 = closest to stepper connector.

toolhead pcb:
silkscreen errors: IO.2 (PB7) silkscreen says 24v, this is actually 5v
silkscreen errors: (PB6) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
silkscreen errors: IN.0 (PA3) is actually 24v, not 5v as printed
also CANL and CANH are "TX and RX" respectively as printed.

IN.0 = will be for X endstop
IO.1 = ERCF filament sensor
IO.2 = optoTAP sensor

since last update:
installed TAP
swapped Pi4b for CM4
tore out X drag chain
solved weird back-slanted bed mesh by adjusting the Y extrusion where it meets the frame (just on the right side) until bed mesh was much better
put pi-cam-v3 on (standard angle) and deemed it too narrow for use in the enclosure, tried 3 spots, bought a wide angle.
found mound of black abs dust gathered below the extruder atop the toolhead "cartridge". uh oh. spent a bunch of time diagnosing this.
  another video by "Dave" on discord led to the correct way to fit the antisquish screw and adjust gear mesh. the former should 100% solve 
  the grinding to dust issue. can't find worn pieces?

update 4/7/2023: got SB rebuilt and live adjusted Y extrusion on right side again, ran the probe accuracy scripts, came out decent. 
Installed new wide angle pi camera, oh boy is it wide. Can see one of my monitors.

however new problems: 
extruder has a nice click when retracting / unretracting. maybe set the gear mesh a little too loose
The big issue is loud grinding when Z is +25 or so and in a big move. Printer needs to be stripped down at least partly to determine why this change happened. 
suspect it's the front left.

new update 4/23/2023
 - Overheating toolhead pcb! While printing a small batch of small parts, all close together, the toolhead MCU jumped to just over 100Â°C and crashed
   with an adc temp error. This was while I had no cover installed at all. I found a SB cable cover with 3010 fan and built it out. Downside it runs
   at all times when the printer is powered (currently using IN.0 for its 24v and ground, the PB6 pin is unused). Should split with the toolhead heat sink
   fan so it will go on and off.
 - Got two "production" and one "fixer upper" Disco on a Sticks from deathbyxbox to install along top frame L, front, R. Looks great. Working on baffles
   when the toolhead MCU crashed.

new update 5/16/2023
Taking printer out of service to do a bunch of minor upgrades.
 - 3 disco sticks with (18) SK6822 RGBCW's on each now installed with an esp8266-based "yawl-controller". Power is fed from the 5A available to a raspberry pi from the
   Spider, which wasn't being used as I prefer the Meanwell 25-5 supply for the Pi with its separate AC power switch. The LEDs should not draw more than 3.1A but I should be
   careful since dupont pin headers aren't rated for more than 2.5A. Having lights powered by the Spider does mean when the Spider is powered off, there's no lights.
 - Added BME680 sensor wired to I2C on the Pi. Added the Pi as an MCU as well. Added to Klipper and it shows up on the Moonraker UI. That was easy. Found a print to mount it to
   an extrusion.
 - Relocate Y endstop switch to the back of the right side Y extrusion. Didn't seem to work on testing endstops in the GUI, need to break out a multimeter. Of course.
   Bummer, I already fixed all the wiring in place and made it look neat. Before testing it. Dumb.
 - ToDo: Rebuild TAP using r8 parts and better magnets. Add X endstop switch there. Thinking about rebuilding SB with a better print but that's a hassle and may just skip it.
 - ToDo: build new Nevermore and mount in the back, pointing upward
 - ToDo: rebuild SB cover fan wiring to share toolhead's fan output for the cold side heatsink. Why? We need IN.0 for the new X endstop switch.
 
Far off in the future todo's:
  - ERCF
  - TinyFan v2 board + 4 wires added to umbilical = add PWM fan with tachometer to toolhead cold side heatsink fan. Macros available to monitor the fan speed and shut down
    the print job to protect against clogs deep in the hot end.
  - Serial connection to UART2 on the Pi4b for the WLED controller, so no wifi necessary to operate WLED (this is a big maybe .. is it even worth the effort, since I like the GUI?)
  - Redo BME680 wires with slightly longer, hopefully much prettier wire or cable
