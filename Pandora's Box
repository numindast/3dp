  - Stepper drivers (2209's) are installed; AB motors use diag pins so no endstops on MIN1/MIN2 possible. The Z motors don't.
  - Z endstop is on MIN3
  - All steppers buzz correctly (yet to test extruder), toolhead fans work properly, hot end heats up and temps look correct.

  - First boot: klipper v0.12.0-143 successfully running on the Manta via SD card (omg, full size SD card, not even mini or micro). Hopeful to attain DFU mode.

  - Wired the AC combo inlet to the power supply. Made the ground cord long enough to reach some Wago's if I decide I want more grounding available.
  - Still trying to make a dragonburner that has an actual probe on it. Purchased Fysetc Klicky PCB kit and printing a new DragonBurner cowl with no probe. Caza's mod in PB repo for a mount.
