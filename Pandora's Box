Start of notes. Much to be added.

Controller: BTT Manta M5P
Very good resource: https://3dwork.io/en/bigtreetech-manta-m8p-m5p-m4p-e3ez-review-and-complete-guide/#m5p_klipper
Also very good resource. Use this to do firmware. https://canbus.esoterical.online/
Also very good resource. Use this to do firmware. Automatically?!?!? KIAUH does firmware now ??

Notes:
  klicky_pcb is the Z endstop pin since the nozzle can't reach behind the bed in a pandoraboxen.

  - Stepper drivers (2209's) are installed; AB motors use diag pins so no endstops on MIN1/MIN2 possible. The Z motors don't.
  - Z endstop is on MIN3 and still needs to be tested physically
  - All steppers buzz correctly (yet to test extruder), toolhead fans work properly, hot end heats up and temps look correct.
  - Dragonburner LEDs reconfigured and up and running

  - First boot: klipper v0.12.0-143 successfully running on the Manta via SD card (omg, full size SD card, not even mini or micro). Hopeful to attain DFU mode.

  - Wired the AC combo inlet to the power supply. Made the ground cord long enough to reach some Wago's if I decide I want more grounding available.
  - Still trying to make a dragonburner that has an actual probe on it. Purchased Fysetc Klicky PCB kit and printing a new DragonBurner cowl with no probe. Caza's mod in PB repo for a mount.
