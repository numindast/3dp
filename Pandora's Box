### Serial number P.036

Start of notes. Much to be added.

Controller: BTT Manta M5P
Very good resource: https://3dwork.io/en/bigtreetech-manta-m8p-m5p-m4p-e3ez-review-and-complete-guide/#m5p_klipper
Also very good resource. Use this to do firmware. https://canbus.esoterical.online/
Also very good resource. Use this to do firmware. Automatically?!?!? KIAUH does firmware now ??
  firmware:

Controller: BTT EBB36 v1.2
  firmware: 

Notes:
  klicky_pcb is the Z endstop pin since the nozzle can't reach behind the bed in a pandoraboxen.

  - Installed the spacers. Replaced the two 4010 part cooling fans, one wasn't working. Tracked down the lost CAN toolhead communication to a break
    in the CAN umbilical wire. Which is the stuff BTT ships with SB2209's. That is very annoying. Cut another stretch to use and installed (from the same donor cable...)

  // Using 0.4mm west3d 'undertaker' nozzle now. Rapido HF still installed.
  // Fitted shaper 'mzv' frequency = 51.4 Hz (vibrations = 2.3%, smoothing ~= 0.087)
  // To avoid too much smoothing with 'mzv', suggested max_accel <= 7800 mm/sec^2
  // Fitted shaper '2hump_ei' frequency = 106.8 Hz (vibrations = 0.0%, smoothing ~= 0.060)
  // To avoid too much smoothing with '2hump_ei', suggested max_accel <= 12700 mm/sec^2

  - EPDM belt was getting chewed on too. Took the B drive top frame off carefully and disassembled the bearing stacks. One extra washer. Yup. That'd do it.
  - Purchased M3 6mm x 9mm spacers to replace the printed ones, as I was concerned about them, perhaps without basis.
  - Printed a bunch of PLA but now toolhead is losing connection with the CAN so have to investigate. Perhaps a better umbilical mount.

  - Replaced chewed up belt with EPDM spare belt. Chewed up a bit of that before disassembling the B drive frame and discovering a bearing stack had an extra washer.
    Running the printer at high speeds and high accels have been flawless ever since. Purchased aluminum M3 spacers (6x9) but have not installed them since the washer discovery.
  - Printed a bunch of PLA with 0.4 brass nozzle, now switching to 0.2 brass and tuning PLA for it.

4/23/2024: 1h 55m 16s (!!!)
  - Finished! Completed wiring, completed adding two matchstick lights, mounted controller to LM200 power supply which is VHB'd at each end to
    mounting brackets from the mods folder on PB github, which screw holes don't work for this model so it's just hanging by VHB and I expect it to fall one day.
    At that point the option is to stick the PSU to the deck plate directly and remove the brackets or design something custom.
  - DragonBurner cowling still has klicky integration, and questionable LEDs. May swap for a non-probe cowling (very clean) and redo the LEDs.
  - Printed two test cubes at this point. That's all, but they came out glorious.
  - All panels mounted, all skirts done, drag chain, a sketchy CAN cable / toolhead PCB mount that's gonna come loose someday.
  - The nameplate near the front of the deck doesn't fit. It's ACM so not sure I have anything that can cut this. Probably going to print something to fit.
  - SERIALED! P.036

  - First plastik pushed! Swapped to Rapido hot end, wired up skirt fans. Still strongly considering redoing the electronics bay. The power supply
    is too long and hangs below the skirts. May just buy a Mornsun 200w or LRS-150 and mount the traditional way. If I have a bottom panel, I want it to fit,
    which probably means doing away with the FT EMS.
  - LEDs are still screwed up, needs work.
  - First print is PA tune on polylite pla. Brass 0.4 nozzle installed.

  - Stepper drivers (2209's) are installed; AB motors use diag pins so no endstops on MIN1/MIN2 possible. The Z motors don't.
  - Z endstop is on MIN3 and still needs to be tested physically
  - All steppers buzz correctly (yet to test extruder), toolhead fans work properly, hot end heats up and temps look correct.
  - Dragonburner LEDs reconfigured and up and running

  - First boot: klipper v0.12.0-143 successfully running on the Manta via SD card (omg, full size SD card, not even mini or micro). Hopeful to attain DFU mode.

  - Wired the AC combo inlet to the power supply. Made the ground cord long enough to reach some Wago's if I decide I want more grounding available.
  - Still trying to make a dragonburner that has an actual probe on it. Purchased Fysetc Klicky PCB kit and printing a new DragonBurner cowl with no probe. Caza's mod in PB repo for a mount.
