Start of notes. Much to be added.

4/6/2024: 
  - Wired the AC combo inlet to the power supply. Made the ground cord long enough to reach some Wago's if I decide I want more grounding available.
  - Still trying to make a dragonburner that has an actual probe on it. Purchased Fysetc Klicky PCB kit and printing a new DragonBurner cowl with no probe. Caza's mod in PB repo for a mount.
